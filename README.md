## Hello, World! :)


A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the console. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.

Printing to the console is mainly used as a monitoring tool, ideally to leave a trace of the content of variables during execution of a program.


## Variables 

What is a variable?

A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
We can also use the console.log() function to print variables in the console. It is a great way to know their content!

### Variable types

There are a few different types of data we can store in variables. 

1. Numbers
2. Strings: pieces of text
3. Booleans: true/false values 
4- Arrays: a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.
5- Objects: in programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.
