# JavaScript from zero


## Hello, World! :)


A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the console. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.

Printing to the console is mainly used as a monitoring tool, ideally to leave a trace of the content of variables during execution of a program.


## Variables 

### What is a variable?

A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
We can also use the console.log() function to print variables in the console. It is a great way to know their content!

### Variable types

There are a few different types of data we can store in variables. 

1. Numbers
2. Strings: pieces of text. A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
3. Booleans: true/false values. True means “yes, correct”, and False means “no, incorrect”.
4. Arrays: a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.
5. Objects: in programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.
6. Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.
7. Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler.

## Comments

As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.
Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.

Like this: 

1. One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //
2. Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */
