# Hello, World! :)


## JavaScript from zero


A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the console. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.

Printing to the console is mainly used as a monitoring tool, ideally to leave a trace of the content of variables during execution of a program.
